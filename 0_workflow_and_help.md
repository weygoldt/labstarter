# 🧑‍💻 General Workflow & Getting Help

## How We Work
Our lab has an open and collaborative atmosphere. We encourage asking
questions, discussing ideas, and helping each other. However, it’s also
important to balance this with working independently and making sure we respect
everyone’s focus time. Here’s how to approach problems and questions
efficiently.

## What Should You Do in Your First Week?
Getting started in a new lab can be overwhelming, so here’s a quick checklist for your first week:

1. **Read Key Documentation** – Familiarize yourself with this guide!
2. **Get a key** - Talk to our secretary Yvonne to get a key to the lab.
3. **Set Up Your Environment** – Install necessary software (Python packages, Git, etc.) and get access to lab resources. Your supervisor or peers can help you with this.
4. **Understand Your Project** – Discuss expectations, objectives, and milestones with your supervisor. Start reading the associated literature.
5. **Start Small** – Work through a simple task related to your project to get hands-on experience.
6. **Keep a Notebook** – Document everything you do from day one.

## General Workflow
To keep research efficient and reproducible, follow these best practices:

1. **Plan Your Work** – Before diving in, outline your objectives, expected outcomes, and steps.
2. **Keep a Lab Notebook** – If you record data, document what you do, why you do it, and any unexpected observations there can not be no too much metadata, just too little of it.
3. **Use Version Control** – Store code and analysis scripts in Git to track changes and collaborate smoothly.
4. **Organize Your Data Properly** – Use structured directories, clear file names, and metadata to make datasets easy to find and understand.
5. **Write Reproducible Code** – Use scripts instead of manual steps; prefer Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for analysis.
6. **Back Up Your Work Regularly** – Ensure raw data, scripts, and results are safely stored and versioned. If you are unsure how to do this, just ask for help!

## Before Asking for Help
The best way to learn is by **trying to solve a problem yourself first**. Before reaching out, go through these steps:

1. **Search online** – Many common issues have been encountered before. Try Googling or checking Stack Overflow.
2. **Check this guide** – We have documentation that covers many lab-specific topics. See if your question is already answered.
3. **Experiment a bit** – If it’s a coding or analysis problem, try debugging or testing different approaches. Do **not** rely on an AI chatbot to do the experimenting for you. `IPython.embed()`, `print`-statements or a debugger is your best friend!
4. **Take notes** – If you're stuck but it’s not urgent, write it down and continue working on something else.

## When and How to Ask for Help
If you still can’t solve the issue after trying the steps above, don’t hesitate to ask! Here’s how to do it effectively:

- **If it’s urgent (blocking your work completely) or live animals are involved, always ask right away!**
- **If it’s not urgent, write down your questions and ask when you have multiple things to discuss.** This way, we can go through them more efficiently at once.
- **Be specific** – Instead of “It doesn’t work,” describe what you tried, what you expected, and what happened.

## Respecting Everyone’s Time
We love discussing ideas and helping each other, but constant interruptions can break focus. To keep the lab running smoothly:

- Try to batch non-urgent questions and discuss them at a good time. This is usually more effective than interrupting someone for just a few minutes.
- If someone looks deeply focused, consider sending a message instead of interrupting.
- If you notice you’re often asking about the same thing, it might be worth learning that topic in more depth.

**The bottom line: Be curious, try first, ask smartly, and respect focus time.** Learning to troubleshoot is part of becoming a good researcher!
