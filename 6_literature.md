# üìö Literature Research & Writing Guide

Writing scientific documents is a key skill in research. Whether you're working
on a thesis, a manuscript, or a report, this guide will help you get started
with tools for writing and managing citations efficiently.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Your Thesis or Manuscript

Most of us use **LaTeX** for writing scientific documents, as it provides
excellent control over formatting and citations. If you plan to stay in
science, it's worth learning. 

- **Getting Started with LaTeX**: The easiest way to begin is by using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online LaTeX editor that requires no installation.
- **Templates**: Many students and PhD researchers in the lab already have LaTeX templates for theses and papers. Don't hesitate to ask‚Äîpeople are happy to share.
- **Alternative Options**: If you prefer working in a visual text editor like **Word, Google Docs, or OpenOffice**, you are free to do so. Just ensure your references are well-managed.

## üîç Managing Citations & References

Properly managing your references saves time and ensures consistency.

### BibTeX & Google Scholar
If you use LaTeX, you can collect citations easily from **Google Scholar**:
1. Search for the paper.
2. Click the **quote icon** ("Cite").
3. Select **BibTeX** and copy the citation.
4. Paste it into your `citations.bib` file.

### Zotero: A More Advanced Reference Manager
For a more flexible and automated workflow, consider using **[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)**. It‚Äôs free, open-source, and has useful features like:
- A browser extension to save papers with one click.
- Automatic metadata collection for proper citations.
- Exporting references to `.bib` format for LaTeX.
- Syncing your library across devices.

Some people in the lab (ask **Patrick** or **Alex**) use Zotero and can help
you set it up. Zotero can also keep your `.bib` file automatically updated when
you add new references.

No matter which tool you use, keeping an organized reference list will make
writing much easier. Happy writing! ‚úçÔ∏è
