# ü§ñ Using AI for Research: Best Practices & Pitfalls

AI can be a powerful tool in research, but it‚Äôs very easy to misuse. In our
lab, we primarily use AI for assistance with **code** and **manuscripts**. This
guide outlines the right way to use AI while ensuring you remain in control of
your work.

## üñ•Ô∏è AI for Writing Code

### ‚úÖ **When to Use AI for Coding**
- If you have a **radical new idea** and want to quickly prototype a concept without much initial investment, AI can help generate a **starting point**.
- If you're **stuck on a problem**, AI can provide **alternative approaches** that you might not have considered.
- AI-generated code should be used as **inspiration, never as a final solution**.

### ‚ùå **What to Avoid**
- **Never rely on AI to write your code for you.** It often produces code that appears correct but contains **subtle errors**.
- **Always review the AI-generated code** before running it. Read every line to ensure you understand what it does.
- **Use interactive debugging tools** (`IPython.embed()` or print statements) whenever AI-generated code introduces something unfamiliar.
- **AI should assist your learning, not replace it.** If you blindly trust AI, you will never develop real programming skills.

### üöÄ **Using GitHub Copilot**
GitHub Copilot works directly in your editor and makes **auto-suggestions**
while you type. It can significantly speed up coding, especially for repetitive
tasks like creating figures or structuring code. However:

- If you notice you‚Äôre relying too much on auto-completers, try **disabling them for a few days**. This self-check helps you assess your actual coding ability and prevents over-reliance.
- If you find that you are unable to write anything without AI, stick with regular old google search for a few weeks. You will quickly see the difference.

## üìÑ AI for Writing Manuscripts

### ‚úÖ **When to Use AI for Writing**
- AI can help **rephrase or refine your wording** to improve clarity.
- AI can suggest **alternative ways to express an idea**, making your writing more polished.
- AI-generated text can serve as **inspiration**, but you must write and structure the **content** yourself.

### ‚ùå **What to Avoid**
- **Never use AI to generate full sections of content.** It‚Äôs your responsibility to produce original work.
- **Using AI to generate content without modification is plagiarism.** Scientific writing is about articulating your ideas, not rewording AI outputs.
- **AI lacks critical thinking.** It can generate plausible-sounding text that may be factually incorrect or lack nuance.

## üìö AI for Researching New Topics

AI can be a great tool for quickly getting an overview of new topics like **deep learning, statistics, or signal processing**. However:
- If you **never go beyond asking AI**, your knowledge will remain shallow.
- A good approach is to **balance** AI assistance with reading books, implementing algorithms yourself, and then using AI like a tutor when you have **specific questions** that books or primary sources couldn‚Äôt answer.

By using AI wisely, you can enhance your research workflow while still developing essential skills in coding and writing. üöÄ
